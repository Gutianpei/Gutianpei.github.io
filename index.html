			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> I'm a Resaerch Assistant at <a href="http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Intelligent Vision Group (IVG)</a>, Department of Automation, <b>Tsinghua University</b>, under the guidance of <a href="http://ivg.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/Jiwen_Lu/">Prof. Jiwen Lu</a>. In December 2020, I received B.S. degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Maryland. Before joined IVG, I did research at <a href="http://prg.cs.umd.edu/">Perception and Robotics Group (PRG)</a> in the <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, <b>University of Maryland</b>, under the guidance of <a href="http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~yiannis/">Prof. Yiannis Aloimonos</a>.
				My research interest is in <b>Computer Vision</b>, especially <b>Person Re-identification</b> and <b>Causal Inference</b>. You can find my <a href="docs/GTP CV.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> here.

				<strong>[1] Person Re-Identification via Attention Pyramid</strong>
				<br>
				Guangyi Chen, <strong>Tianpei Gu</strong>, Jiwen Lu, Jin-an Bao, Jie Zhou
				<br>
				<em>Submitted to IEEE Transcations on Image Processing(<strong>TIP</strong>), 2020</em>
				<p>We designed a novel attention pyarmid structure to help the network focus more on local feature while keep the global representation.</p>

				<strong>[2] Learnable Re-Ranking for Image Retrieval</strong>
				<br>
				<strong>Tianpei Gu</strong>, Guangyi Chen, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou
				<br>
				<em>Submitted to the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision(<strong>ICCV</strong>), 2021</em>
				<p>We proposed a Graph Neural Network to formulate re-ranking as a learnable process.</p>

			<h1>Research Experience</h1>
					
			<h3>3-D Reconstruction</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Researching on state-of-art 3D Reconstruction method, especially reconstruct with <a href="https://smpl.is.tue.mpg.de/">SMPL model</a>.</li>
				<li>Customized existing 3D construction methods to fit our dataset; maintained the human 3D reconstruction methods survey for the lab. </li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Person Re-identification</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Proposed a novel CNN-based network to re-identify person based on their movement style. </li>
				<li>Built an online and in-memory system to re-identify people with 85% accuracy under clean image setting.</li>
				<li>Propose to draw the counterfactual causality from the traditional trained "biased" network to infer the effect from bad bias, then remove them. Proposed a novel deep neural network for Person Re-ID task to make causal intervention in training and counterfactual reasoning in inference to remove the bad while keep the good features. </li>
				<li>Proposed an attention pyramid structure for Person Re-ID task to focus more on local attention of the feature map while keep the global attention of a human image. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin with -40% computational cost. The work has been submitted to TIP.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Text-based Person Search</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Proposed a novel CNN-based network for text-based person search, using Resnet50 and Bi-LSTM as backbone network</li>
				<li>Improved performance by adding Batch Normalization and Instance Normalization layers into our network and employing the triplet loss as the loss function. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h1>Field Experience</h1>
			
			<h3>Beijing Photon Dance Tech Inc.</h3>
			Co-Founder, Algorithm Engineer
			<ul>
				<li>Founded in Skywork Team, Tsinghua University.</li>
				<li>Proposed an end-to-end solution from extracted 3D point cloud with multiple views to automatic motion difference evaluating. Participated in multi-view point cloud calibration and developing of DL-based merging algorithm.</li>
				<li>Our team just receive the Angle Investment.</li>
			</ul>
